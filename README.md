Kero Master: Kaeru

A 3D platformer group project. Where the player can switch between first and third person perspectives to move between catching and platforming. Use the frog's tongue to grapple onto vines and catch flies to fill your stomach!

Created by Justin Ward, Ranen Fernandes and Andrei Constantin during Term 2 of First Year for the Games and Interactive Systems module.
